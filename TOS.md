ViewMinder Terms of Service & Refund Policy

This document outlines the agreement between ViewMinder and the client using our inspection proxy services.

1. Scope of Service (The Liability Shield)

ViewMinder provides a visual inspection and proxy attendance service only. Our proxies report on visible conditions at the time of inspection. We are not licensed building inspectors, structural engineers, or pest controllers. We do not guarantee the approval of your tenancy application.

By using this service, you acknowledge that you are applying for the property at your own risk and ViewMinder is not liable for any defects discovered after the lease commences (e.g., termites, major structural issues, boundary disputes, or changes in neighborhood conditions).

2. ViewMinder Confidence Guarantee (Refunds)

We offer a 100% Money-Back Guarantee under two strict conditions, ensuring the service is delivered as promised:

Non-Attendance: If our assigned proxy fails to attend the scheduled inspection, you will receive a full refund.

Non-Delivery: If we fail to deliver the promised components (the Agent Check-in, the 15-Point Report, and the HD Recorded Walkthrough/Live Call Summary) to your provided email address within 2 hours of the inspection ending.

No Refund Scenarios:

If your tenancy application is unsuccessful.

If you dislike the property based on the information provided in the report (the service is to report, not to endorse).

If you cancel the booking less than 24 hours prior to the inspection time.

3. Data and Privacy

We use your booking data to facilitate the inspection and communicate with you. Your data is not shared with third parties except as necessary for payment processing (Stripe) and lead capture (Webhook/Zapier).
